TOMORROW
--------
1. Code polishing
   
   - use an 'event=order_created' scope in the exchanged access token
   - tokens with an event claim not usable in HTTP requests?

2. Get rid of shipping from repo but include a diagram in the architecture article.

3. API gateway
   Do introspection which can route to local computer, then remove introspection from the client bash 

4. Final client
   Write a console client listening on a loopback URL and get a user level token
   Must route back to host when running DEPLOYED
